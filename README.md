# Getting Starterd
Crud application: includes login, signup, add user data crud functionality with session management in ember.js with couchdb as offline database.
Some points:
1. Error are displayed on browser's console
2. After login and signup input if nothing happens- it means in case of login credentials are wrong and in case of registeration email is already taken (error can be seen in browser's console window), adding details of a user is done only once and after that updation is required.
3. adding of details of user is executed through their session name(which is same in every case with variable id), session name also acts as primary key for documents in couchdb.
